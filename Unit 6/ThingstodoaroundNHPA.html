		<h1>Things to do around New Hope</h1>
		<h2>Go hiking at Goat Hill</h2>
		<p>The hike up to the top of Goat Hill is quite unique, it's a pretty easy hike
but has some steep parts along the way.<br> The hike is beautiful 
and allows you to connect you the outdoors and nature. It gives you a break from the<br> noisy and busy streets of downtown.
Once you reach the top of Goat Hill you get a spectacular view of the
Deleware River,<br> the New Hope-Lambertville bridge, and New Hope its self. On top of the hill there are
a couple picnic tables so you can eat lunch.<br> If you like hiking an nature that I would highly suggest putting this
in you plans when coming down to New Hope.</p>
		<h2>Tubing down the Deleware River</h2>
		<p>Obviously, this is only something you can only do when it's warm
out. So doing this during the summer or maybe<br> spring and fall if its warm enough would be a great idea. This is a great activity
you can do with friends and family and is very relaxing.<br> Just make sure to keep you but up because some of the rocks stick up out of the water. 
Also, for saftey reasons make sure that<br> everyone is wearing their life vests at all times, as their are some tiny rapids in the river.
If you do want to do this,<br> I would suggest starting twenty minutes up the river from New Hope, around the Stockton area.
<br>This would give you about two hours, depeding on the speed of the current, in the water. All that being said,<br> 
tubing down the river is a great activity to do and will be fun for all.</p>
		<h2>Walk around Lambertville plus the bridge</h2>
		<p>Being in New Hope you are bound to look across the river at
some point. When you do, you will be looking at Lambertville in New Jersey!<br>
Taking the bridge over you can have two feet in two different states at the 
same time. Lambertville isn't as nice as New Hope,<br> but still very nice. It has some nice places to eat just across the bridge and has
easy access to the water.<br> It has a wonderful hotel just as you cross over 
the bridge giving a great angle of New Hope, Lambertville, and the bridge.<br> And
its always fun to explore new things right!</p>
