		<h1>Top Places to eat at while in New Hope(add links of the menus</h1>
		<h2>Freds</h2>
		<p>Fred's is a resturant that only serves breakfeast. Its a great way to kick off
you day.<br> Its a little shack that serves about fifty at a time, and makes about any breakfeast food
you would want.<br> Some popular foods on their menu are french toast, scrambled eggs, and personally 
my favorite, cinamon buns.<br> Although Freds serves fantatstic food, it's not easy to get to. The
parking is very limited and to actually get into<br> the restrurant you need to be a member 
or have a guest card, without a card you cannot get in.<br> But once you get in, it's so worth it
and I highly recommed you check it out at you vist to New Hope.</p>
		<h2>Spatola's Pizza</h2>
		<p>Spatola's Pizza is a very popular eating spot in town because it's the only pizza place. 
It serves a wide variety of pizzas like,<br> pasta pizza and cheese steak pizza(with or without sauce). In addition
, Spatola's offers free refills on any kind of drink you ordered.<br> This resturant will not take a long time to eat
and is a good pitstop on your trip to New Hope. After about fifteen minutes<br> eating you should be 
on your way again!</p>
		<h2>Moo Burger</h2>
		<p>Moo Burger is a cute little resturant that offers healthy and great tasting 
burgers. It was created three years ago<br> but despite it's high prices, it still generates a lot of
interest in their burgurs. But not only do you get a burger,<br> you get fries and a milkshake if 
you so choose. Now you may be thinking, this sounds like McDonals,<br> well no these burgers
are much more healthier than the ones McDonalds make, and taste a whole lot better as well.<br>
Just like Spatola's this is a quicker way to eat as it would be a good stop on your 
journey through New Hope.</p>
