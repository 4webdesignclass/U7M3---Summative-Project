		<h1>New Hope PA</h1>
		<h3>About New Hope</h3>
		<p>New Hope is a small town located in Bucks County Pennsylvannia. It was founded
in 1939 and holds one of the nation's oldest summer theatres, the Bucks County Playhouse(bottom right). The town 
lays beside the Deleware River, which is famous for the time that George Washington crossed it on 
December 25, 1776 during the American Revolutionary War. Along with the town's unique history, 
the town also offers lovely stores for good shopping any time of the year. Even though New Hope 
only has a population of about 2,500 people, the small packed town attracts great crowds over the
weekends. Just to add to the fun, in the summer once a month the town sets off fireworks! Plus when
you done shopping and eating you can just walk down to the water. Another plus to visiting 
New Hope PA is that everybody here is generly nice and would love to help you out
with any questions you have and show you around. In conclusion, if you are in the Bucks County area any time soon, 
I would suggest taking a trip down to New Hope to enjoy some good shopping, food, and 
fireworks on the river! *Navigation(grey, white, black mix)
